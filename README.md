# Hangman-and-other-examples
Hangman template and step-by-step instructions for beginners and small assignment to get comfortable with loops

You will find two main files here 1) Assignment and 2) Hangman

These files are meant for Python beginners and those who are slightly familiar with Python but have experience in other programming languages

1) Try the assignment first to get comfortable with syntaxes and logic in Python

2) Then try building the hangman game from the template. It also has detailed instructions specifically directed towards beginners. Programmers with intermediate knowledge can use the algorithm at the beginning of the Python file to build their own version of the game.

3) The word file used for the hangman program is sourced from: http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/wordlist/wordsEn.txt
The Python program also mentions this specifically

4) The final file is my version of Hangman that's built based on the template.
